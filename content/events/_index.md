{{< icon "calendar" >}} **MICR Online Kick-Off Meeting**

We’re pleased to share the exciting news that our project “MICR: Towards a Modular Infrastructure for Comprehensive RDM” has been awarded funding through the TDCC-SSH Challenge Call 2024 by NWO. 

To start things off, we’re organizing an Online Kick-Off Meeting on June 24 to walk you through the next steps. A Save-the-Date invitation will follow via Outlook. The detailed agenda will be included in that invitation closer to the kick-off, but here’s a preview of what to expect: 

* A brief recap of the project’s purpose and scope 
* Introduction of the TDCC-SSH team and discussion of their role in MICR 
* Presentation of our research instruments (policy inventory, use cases and survey) 
* Initial coordination efforts to align with other relevant projects

### Online Kick-Off Meeting: 24 June 11.00 - 13.00
